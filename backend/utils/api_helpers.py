"""Shared helpers for Anthropic API call construction.

The main export is ``build_cached_call_kwargs`` — it constructs the
``client.messages.create(**kwargs)`` payload with Anthropic prompt
caching turned on for the static instructions block. Use it anywhere
the prompt has a stable instruction block ≥1024 tokens that repeats
across calls (Sonnet/Opus minimum; Haiku needs ≥2048).

Pattern:
    1. Move all the static rules / format / template instructions into a
       single string passed as ``system_text``.
    2. Move all per-call dynamic data (applicant name, banking context,
       reasons, ...) into a single string passed as ``user_text``.
    3. The helper wraps the system text in a ``cache_control: ephemeral``
       block — Anthropic stores its processed form server-side for 5 min,
       charging 0.1× the normal input rate on subsequent hits in that
       window. Misses pay 1.25× (small one-time write cost), so the
       break-even is ~2-3 calls per 5-min window.

Tools / temperature / max_tokens / model and any other kwargs pass
through unchanged via ``**other_kwargs``.

    """Build a kwargs dict for ``client.messages.create`` with the system
    block cached via Anthropic prompt caching (5-min ephemeral TTL).

    Cache key: the entire prompt prefix up to and including the
    ``cache_control`` marker. That covers ``system_text`` PLUS any earlier
    static blocks Anthropic processes before it — most notably the
    ``tools`` list passed via ``**other_kwargs``. Mutating any of those
    pieces (system text, tools schema, tool choice) invalidates the cache,
    so keep them byte-identical across calls in the same 5-min window.

    ``user_text`` is the dynamic per-call payload — it sits in the
    ``messages`` array AFTER the cached prefix and is not part of the
    cache key. Put applicant data, retry feedback, and anything
    per-call here.

    Any additional keyword arguments — ``model``, ``max_tokens``,
    ``temperature``, ``tools``, ``tool_choice``, etc. — pass through.
    Returns a dict you can splat into ``client.messages.create(**kw)``
    or any wrapper (e.g. ``guarded_api_call(client, **kw)``).
