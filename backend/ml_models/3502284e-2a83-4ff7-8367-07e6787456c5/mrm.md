## 2. Purpose & limitations

General-purpose PD estimation across AU retail loan products. Not validated for: business lending, secured non-home lending, applicants outside AU residency, loans > $5M, loans with unusual repayment structures (balloon, interest-only > 5yr).

All scope boundaries above reflect the training distribution. The policy overlay runs in `enforce` mode in this deployment. Out-of-scope predictions are blocked by the overlay and routed to manual underwriter review (see §9 P-codes).

## 3. Data lineage

- **Source:** synthetic (DataGenerator v1 + GMSC real-data benchmark)
- **Synthetic vs real:** synthetic
- **Class balance (positive rate):** unknown
- **Reject-inference usage:** not applied
- **Temporal coverage:** unknown → unknown

Reject-inference is not applied for this version; the accept-only training distribution is a known bias risk and is mitigated through ongoing PSI monitoring (§10) + quarterly challenger retraining.

## 4. Monotonicity constraint table

| Feature | Sign | Rationale |
|---|---|---|
| `annual_income` | +1 (↑) | Higher income increases serviceability — core AU responsible-lending assumption. |
| `avg_monthly_savings_rate` | +1 (↑) | Positive savings rate demonstrates cash-flow surplus. |
| `consumer_confidence` | +1 (↑) | Higher macro confidence lowers tail-event probability during loan term. |
| `credit_history_months` | +1 (↑) | More history = thicker file; thin files penalised across AU bureaux. |
| `credit_score` | +1 (↑) | Higher Equifax score indicates lower historical default probability. |
| `debt_service_coverage` | +1 (↑) | DSCR > 1 means income covers repayments with buffer; linear in safety. |
| `deposit_amount` | +1 (↑) | Larger deposit reduces LVR and demonstrates savings discipline. |
| `deposit_ratio` | +1 (↑) | deposit / loan_amount — direct proxy for equity skin-in-the-game. |
| `document_consistency_score` | +1 (↑) | Consistent docs = lower fraud risk; monotone in data quality. |
| `employment_length` | +1 (↑) | Longer tenure proxies income stability; CBA/NAB scorecards apply length floors. |
| `financial_literacy_score` | +1 (↑) | Higher literacy = better decision making; TMD-aligned protective factor. |
| `has_cosigner` | +1 (↑) | Guarantor increases recovery pool; monotonically safer. |
| `hem_surplus` | +1 (↑) | Income − HEM floor; larger surplus = more serviceability headroom. |
| `income_per_dependant` | +1 (↑) | More income per dependant = more discretionary buffer. |
| `income_source_count` | +1 (↑) | Income diversification reduces concentration risk on a single employer. |
| `income_verification_score` | +1 (↑) | CDR/Basiq-confirmed income is strictly safer than self-attested. |
| `is_existing_customer` | +1 (↑) | Known customer behaviour is strictly more informative than acquired-unknown. |
| `log_annual_income` | +1 (↑) | Log transform of annual_income; monotone transform, same sign as source. |
| `months_since_last_default` | +1 (↑) | Longer since default = more recovery evidence; monotone in safety. |
| `net_monthly_surplus` | +1 (↑) | Income − expenses; foundational serviceability quantity. |
| `prepayment_buffer_months` | +1 (↑) | Months of repayments already paid ahead reduces imminent default risk. |
| `property_value` | +1 (↑) | Higher collateral value reduces LGD for secured lending (APS 112). |
| `rent_payment_regularity` | +1 (↑) | Consistent rent payments predict mortgage payment consistency. |
| `salary_credit_regularity` | +1 (↑) | Regular salary credits confirm employment reality, reduce income-fabrication risk. |
| `savings_balance` | +1 (↑) | Larger liquid buffer lowers short-term default risk during shocks. |
| `savings_to_loan_ratio` | +1 (↑) | More savings relative to loan = more shock-absorption capacity. |
| `serviceability_ratio` | +1 (↑) | Aggregated serviceability score; direction matches individual drivers. |
| `uncommitted_monthly_income` | +1 (↑) | After fixed commitments; larger = more affordability buffer. |
| `utility_payment_regularity` | +1 (↑) | Consistent utility payments are a cheap positive signal in thin files. |

| `bnpl_late_payments_12m` | −1 (↓) | BNPL late payments predict revolving-credit late payments. |
| `bnpl_monthly_commitment` | −1 (↓) | Monthly BNPL scheduled repayments; direct expense. |
| `bnpl_total_limit` | −1 (↓) | Total BNPL exposure; larger = more hidden serviceability drag. |
| `bnpl_utilization_pct` | −1 (↓) | BNPL used ÷ limit; high use signals liquidity stress. |
| `bureau_risk_score` | −1 (↓) | Higher bureau risk score = more recently adverse activity. |
| `cash_advance_count_12m` | −1 (↓) | Cash advances indicate short-term liquidity stress; high rate-cost. |
| `credit_card_burden` | −1 (↓) | Derived: card limits / income; same direction as limits. |
| `credit_utilization_pct` | −1 (↓) | Above 70% utilisation is a top-3 bureau-score negative in AU. |
| `days_in_overdraft_12m` | −1 (↓) | More days negative = tighter cash-flow margin; monotone worse. |
| `days_negative_balance_90d` | −1 (↓) | Recent days in negative balance = cashflow fragility. |
| `debt_to_income` | −1 (↓) | APRA limits above DTI=6; higher = less serviceability (APS 220 focus). |
| `effective_loan_amount` | −1 (↓) | Loan + LMI (what actually appears on the mortgage); same direction as loan_amount. |
| `enquiry_intensity` | −1 (↓) | Enquiries per open account; high velocity = shopping-for-credit stress. |
| `essential_to_total_spend` | −1 (↓) | Higher essentials ratio = less discretionary buffer to cut. |
| `existing_credit_card_limit` | −1 (↓) | More unused revolving limit inflates stressed serviceability commitments. |

| `has_bankruptcy` | −1 (↓) | Bankruptcy is a hard-fail predictor historically; monotone worse. |
| `hecs_debt_balance` | −1 (↓) | HECS balance proxies future HELP repayment; higher = more drag. |
| `help_repayment_monthly` | −1 (↓) | HELP/HECS repayment reduces post-tax serviceability income. |
| `hem_gap` | −1 (↓) | Negative gap means HEM > income (hard-fail); magnitude monotonic in severity. |
| `income_verification_gap` | −1 (↓) | Mismatch between stated and verified income; higher = higher fraud risk. |
| `lmi_premium` | −1 (↓) | LMI charged only above 80% LVR; higher = higher-LVR loan = riskier. |
| `loan_amount` | −1 (↓) | Larger loans = larger repayment shocks under stress. |

| `log_loan_amount` | −1 (↓) | Log transform of loan_amount; monotone transform, same sign. |
| `lvr` | −1 (↓) | Key secured-lending risk variable; APRA flags LVR > 80% and LMI-required bands. |
| `lvr_x_dti` | −1 (↓) | Interaction of two negative drivers; sign is the product: negative. |
| `monthly_expenses` | −1 (↓) | Higher declared expenses reduce serviceability surplus. |
| `monthly_rent` | −1 (↓) | Current rent is effectively baseline housing commitment; larger = less surplus. |
| `num_bnpl_accounts` | −1 (↓) | More BNPL accounts = more hidden commitments (CCR gap; 2024 ASIC concern). |
| `num_credit_enquiries_6m` | −1 (↓) | Shopping intensity signals financial stress; > 6 enquiries is a red flag. |
| `num_defaults_5yr` | −1 (↓) | Historical defaults are the strongest negative signal in bureau scoring. |
| `num_dishonours_12m` | −1 (↓) | Dishonours indicate cash-flow failures; AFCA/Basiq flags these as leading indicators. |
| `num_hardship_flags` | −1 (↓) | AFCA/ASIC 2023 guidance: hardship history is materially negative. |
| `num_late_payments_24m` | −1 (↓) | CCR-era late payments directly predict future default. |
| `number_of_dependants` | −1 (↓) | More dependants = more baseline expenses (HEM scales with dependants). |
| `overdraft_frequency_90d` | −1 (↓) | Frequent overdraft = recurring cash-flow fragility. |
| `postcode_default_rate` | −1 (↓) | Geographic concentration risk; higher area default rate = worse tail. |

## 5. Performance

Evaluated on hold-out test set (20% of training data):

- **AUC-ROC:** 0.8709
- **KS statistic:** 0.6420
- **Brier score (pointwise):** 0.1371
- **ECE (15-bin):** 0.0337

**Temporal cross-validation:** not recorded

**Baseline logistic-regression gap:** not measured

KS > 0.30 and AUC > 0.75 are the regulator-expected performance floor for AU retail-credit scorecards. Champion-challenger promotion gates exist in `model_selector.py` (PSI, calibration, KS); the current activation path in `tasks.py` activates new models directly, so confirm pre-promotion review for production deployments before relying on these gates.
